Arslan is a bastard with a strong, unruly personality and a distaste for following rules. He joined a mercenary group, where he quickly made a name for himself due to his sharp mind and excellent fighting skills. He lives by the motto: "Only a beautiful body or a foreign land is worth exploring."

## Acquisition

Arslan is a free commander available through the Weirwood Elite Trials at stages 1-12 and 5-3
