Chris's father, Lord of House Aldridge, married for love instead of duty, but held his son to a higher standard. Resentment for this led the young noble to renounce his title when he came of age and venture out into the Seven Kingdoms on his own. Chris experienced hardship, love, and loss; and he witnessed first hand the abuses that those in power often inflict on the poor and the weak. With this learning came the knowledge that his title gave him the ability to make things better, and when the summons came for him to return to home, he was already on his way.

## Acquisition

Chris is the first commander you are given when you open the Weirwood tree. You also get his medals for completing the story quest (note you get enough to make him epic - purple). He is also available in the Weirwood Elite Trials at stages 1-9 and 3-12
