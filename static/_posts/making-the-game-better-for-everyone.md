Disclaimer: I am not a free to play (f2p) player, I am what I guess I would term as a light to moderate spender. So while some of this rant would affect me, it isn't really me that I am advocating for here. 

First some thoughts. This game is fun, I have played it for 282 days as of today. I enjoy a number of aspects of the game, and am certainly not a "hater". However this game is, and is becoming increasingly, pay to win (p2w). Almost every update either adds more p2w features, buffs a p2w feature, and/or nerfs a f2p feature. 

When I started playing, back in K2s infancy, the only real separator between paying players and free players were Royal (t4) troops. Yes there were the $5.5k commanders, but even they weren't really heavily buffed (they are now). The thing is, everyone can have t4s, so the only difference between heavily paying players and everyone else was time, and I am fine with that. I'd prefer a really balanced game where you can't buy power, but if it isn't exclusive power at least there is a light at the end of the tunnel.

Sadly, those days are long gone. There are expensive and seriously over powered commanders, gear, troop appearances, and castle skins. The list just keeps getting longer every time they update the game. This behaviour is detrimental to the game, its overall health and chances of longevity.

One, wrong, opinion, is that free to play players should just be happy with what they get, after all they aren't supporting the game right? Wrong. They are creating a community, they are population, and games like this thrive on population. It's no fun sitting in a kingdom with no one to fight, no one to interact with. It just gets boring. These games need those players to make it fun.

So with this constant pandering to the heavy spenders, and the ever widening gap between them and everyone else, what does the free to play, or even moderate spender have to look forward to? Yes, we can be parts of an alliance, and enjoy the time playing with friends, we can fight among ourselves, hoping some whale doesn't jump in and zero us, but can we ever really compete at an individual level? Nope. Not even kinda. My current 91m power is going to be crushed by these half a billion and up players without them even flinching. They'll wipe out my army and take a few thousand losses, which they'll just heal and rebuild in minutes.

The number of players that just give up and quit when that happens is surprising. I have recently seen 300m plus players quitting after getting zeroed, so where is the incentive to continue if you're 50m? You know you're never going to own Glorious gear, or send 400k marches. You aren't getting the castle skins with the big buffs, or the commanders.

## The Solution

So, what is the solution? It's kind of easy from the developers end. Make nothing pay only. Literally nothing. The biggest issue for most players is they come to the realization that there is no light at the end of the tunnel, it just keeps getting darker. Give them a light, even a dim one is enough to keep a lot of players playing, and to entice new ones to the game.
