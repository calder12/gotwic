Rebel Groups are on the World Map, you are taught how to attack one during the tutorial. You attack a rebel group as you would another player, setting your troops, commanders and dragon. Just like PVP your lord gear that you have equipped, talents and any buffs play a part in your success.

When you first start attacking rebel groups you must beat a level before you are allowed to attack the next level. So you have to beat a level one to attack a level two and so on.

## Drops

The rebel groups have a number of drops including diamonds, speedups, and crafting materials for the Rebel's End lord gear. There are different levels of rebel groups and they are split into drop groups.

* Level 1 to 10 - drop grey crafting materials
* Level 11 to 20 - drop grey and possibly green crafting materials
* level 21 to 25 - drop grey and possibly green or blue crafting materials

**Note** - There are "elite" versions of levels 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 rebel groups. These are denoted by [Elite] preceeded their name in purple. Their drops and strength are the equivalent to moving them up 5 levels. Meaning a level 5 elite is the equivalent strength of a level 10 regular. It also means a level 10 elite will drop the same items as a level 15 regular.

### Elite Specific Drops

Elite rebel groups also drop Oldtown bowmen troop appearance medals randomly. The higher the group level the higher the chance of multiple medals dropping. Level 25 elites for example can drop as many as 8 medals, although that is very rare.

## Attacking 

As mentioned rebel groups are a PVE mechanism but act like PVP attacks. As such you want to set up your attack to counter the group's troops with your formation, commanders, and talents. You can tell a group's formation by clicking on it and looking at the list of its troops. This is in the order of their formation. So in this image this rebel group has a front line of Cavalry and a second line of Spearmen.

As such you want to attack this group with a Spear / Infantry formation and matching commanders.

**Note** - You suffer no losses when attacking rebel groups, you get no wounded or deaths even if you lose.

### Faking formations

You don't actually have to have formations unlocked to counter rebel groups. You can beat any rebel group (that you are strong enough to beat) by sending just the troops required to counter the first troop in their formation. So in the case of the group pictured above you can beat it by sending just Spearmen and Spearmen commanders.

**Note** - level 20 and 25 elite rebel groups are Royal troops, you can beat level 20s if you are a very strong t3 player. Level 25s require t4s for the vast majority of players. If you can send a full march of the first countering troop of t4s, or mostly a full march filled out with the secondary counter you can hunt level 25 elites!

### Gear and Talents

There is no point in changing gear and talents to attack rebel groups, the reward of beating a slightly higher one doesn't recoup the cost of a talent change. The full march of countering t4 troops will beat a level 25 elite group in full eco spec anyway.
