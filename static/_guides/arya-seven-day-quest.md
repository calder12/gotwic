title: Arya Seven Day Quest
date: 2019-12-18T03:04:44.183Z
category: Beginner
---
Very early in the game you will receive a seven day quest to allow you to unlock the commander Arya and upgrade her to blue quality. This quest consists of 3 different tasks with multiple levels, each day and one special purchase.



Each completed task is worth 1 point, each special purchase (blue diamonds) is worth 5 points. All the quests are retroactive, meaning you do not have to do them after they unlock. So for example if you win at the Training Grounds 20 times before day 3 you will be able to unlock that entire tree right away when you get to day 3.



To unlock Arya in blue quality you must attain 100 points of a possible 170 points



Note: The Arya quest is very easily doable even for free to play players and even without buying the special offers!
