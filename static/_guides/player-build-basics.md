This guide is written for free to play (f2p) and moderate spenders primarily. Heavy spenders, or whales, have options that others do not, meaning it is viable for them to take a faster track to higher PVP (player vs player) strength. Understanding that there isn't a real balance of strength in this game is key. If you aren't prepared to spend a lot of money then you also need to understand that how competitive you can be PVP wise is limited, but now how helpful you can be to your alliance mates.

This guide will be pretty high level. There won't be any "research this, then this" in specific trees. Just commentary on what is important and the things you should research/build in a general order.

## T4s / Royal Troops Misconception

I want to touch on this first because so many players get this wrong. T4s are **not** a magic bullet. In fact rushing them for regular players, aka not whales, is a really bad idea for a number of reasons. Without the gear and badges to back them up they aren't that much stronger than t3s, a player with very good tavern buffs, gear and badges is more dangerous and stronger than a player with t4s and none of those other things.

Also they cost a lot. The research is in the hundreds of millions in gold alone. Training them costs exponentially more, and healing / replacing them costs a ton too.

* Training 1,000 t4 cav costs 1m each grain, stone, iron and 500k gold
* Training 1,000 t3 cav costs 146k each grain, stone, iron and 9,700 gold (I do have some cost reduction research for these)

T4 troops also mean things like you burn through your free heals in Alliance Conquest 5 times faster than with t3s. Generally you won't be able to just use free heals in any Alliance Conquest match.


## Research Trees

### Production

You want to get your Building Mastery as high as possible as early as possible. Early in the game building construction speeds are critical. The others in this tree help, but really only need to be done as you can and shouldn't be rushed. Diamond Prospecting is for diamond farming speed after KvK, don't rush this it isn't worth it.

### City Defense

Do these as far as quests force you too, and the ones you can do for free, then ignore it. Like seriously don't do any of them beyond the quests. They're useless.

### Military

Do this tree until you unlock t3s and as far as you can before they start getting really expensive. Your goal here is to be fairly strong without spending 100s of days and hundreds of millions in gold. You'll come back to this eventually though.

### Expedition & Pacification

This is the tree you want to complete as far as you can as fast as you can. You can't do the 10s until you have your Maester Tower to 25 which is horrendously expensive, but getting it to ALL 8s and 9s is key. There are a few reasons for this. First, is the purpose of this tree is to make you stronger hitting rebel leaders and this is one of the most important aspects of the game both personally and for your alliance. You and your alliance mates get a gift for every rebel leader you kill, and the higher the level the better chance at better gifts. These gifts can be diamonds, speedups, resources and alliance coins. The higher you are in this research the higher levels you can kill, the cheaper the motivation cost for hitting them, and you get a higher motivation limit.

Next is gear. Rebel leaders drop the materials you need to craft lord gear in the Blacksmith. The higher you can kill the better possible drops.

* Level 1 - only drops common
* Level 2 - drops common and uncommon - 1 uncommon = 4 commons
* Level 3 - drops common to rare - 1 rare = 16 commmons
* Level 4 - drops common to epic - 1 epic = 64 commons
* Level 5 - drops common to legendary - 1 legendary = 256 commons

You also get better other drops from higher leaders too, more diamonds, better truces, more resources etc.

**This is the most important tree for EVERY regular player! Don't kid yourself into thinking you can rush t4s and ignore this tree, that is a very common and huge mistake**

### Advanced Defense

Do the ones you can do super cheap. Ignore the rest, just like City Defense this is all useless

### Advanced Military

Do the free / cheap ones, then leave this until you get t4s. One caveat is the talent archives and equipment archives are nice to have. Not crucial but nice. More than one equipment archive takes a lot of research though so don't focus on these.

### Formations, Commandership, Refinement

Again, do the free / cheap ones and then wait on these until you have the more important trees done.

### Great City Military

Don't bother with this until everything else is done. This is a whale tree, it is meant for rally leaders and not worth it for f2p or moderate spenders. Even the cheap ones are not worth bothering with.

## Buildings

I am not going to touch on every building here you can read what each one does in game. So just a couple that are important.

### Castle

Getting your castle to 25 is pretty important. Some levels up how many armies you can deploy. Different levels open up the ability to upgrade or build other buidlings. Your castle (obviously) is the most important building in the game.

### Maester Tower

This is easily the second most important building. The higher it is the more researches you are able to do, and the faster those researches get done. Your Maester Tower should always be the first building you upgrade after your Castle.

### Farmlands

Build one. Just one. You will never keep up with feeding troops and trying is a waste of time. Troops don't die if you run out of grain in this game. You need one farmland because some other buildings require it to build/upgrade.

### Army Tents

Don't bother. If you do bother build one, but honestly don't bother. With Barracks upgrades and castle skins you can get a long enough training queue without them, and the 2% defense bonus they offer at level 25 is not worth it either. You're far better off using that space for another mint or hospital.


## Gear

As mentioned in the Expeditions & Pacification reserch topic, gear is huge in this game. Early on you want to focus on 3 sets in particular.

### Champion Gear

This is the easiest gear to build and the most varied for that reason. You get all the materials from gathering from all resource nodes except gold. Getting this set to legendary (gold) is relatively easy and painless. Pro Tip - the faster you gather the more drops you get. And stop worrying about getting high level nodes, all nodes drop all qualities of mats to my knowledge. The only real difference is higher nodes allow you to leave them longer.

Focus on getting your ring and necklace to gold first. The ring gives research bonus and the necklace construction bonus. The chest also gives a research bonus. After those are done focus on the helmet for the training speed bump, then do the others.

### Maester Set and Builder Set

Eventually you want to really focus on research speed bonuses so getting your Maester Set built as fast as possible is big, but early on the Builder Set is important too. The Maester Set pieces all drop from the same leader the Oldtown Student. The Builder Set drops from two leaders, the Crownlands Rioter and the Weseterlands Ore Thief. Early on do not use any extra motivation killing anything but these three horses. I would suggest not crafting the Builder Set beyond them all being blue, the return on investment drops off after that because research is more important than buildings, even with the new glory levels.

### Rebel's End Set

The materials for these drop from Rebel Groups. There are two construction boost pieces, two research boost pieces and one training speed piece. They are all accessories. Since you can only wear two accessories until your Blacksmith is level 25 just focus on the first of the construction and research pieces early on. Once you can wear that third accessory start crafting the second of each.

### All other sets

Each of the other sets has bonuses for different things, different troops strengths etc. Which of these you craft is up to you and the troops you want to use in battle. There are two sets that you cannot get from rebel leaders, gathering or rebel groups. The Mountain Clan Set, which gives you bonuses when hitting rebel leaders, and is a good investment if you spend a bit. And the Glorious Set which is an overpowered set meant for heavy spenders. It is outrageously costly for average players and not worth the cost.
