The Alliance Mobilization Quest can be found up in your top bar where the Elite and Normal quests are. This is an entire alliance quest where each member above castle 15 can accept quests and complete them for points.

The top 5 alliances will move up a tier for the next event, the bottom 5 move down a tier. In the first event all alliances start in the Apprentice tier.

## Important Points
* You must be castle level 15 to participate
* You must be part of the alliance before the quest starts to participate
* Each member gets 9 free quest attempts, a 10th can be purchased for 1k blue diamonds (there is a plus button beside attempts on the main screen)
* Abandoning or failing to finish a quest uses up an attempt
* Rewards must be manually claimed within the prescribed completion time. Simply gathering enough stone, for example, but not claiming the reward will result in a failed quest.

## Strategies
Make sure to read and understand the quest parameters, and pay particular attention to the ones that have large numbers, since the game does not have thousands separators it is easy to mistake 30m for 3m if you aren’t careful

Do not undertake quests you cannot complete. This hurts the alliance, also as noted in the points above you must claim the reward for it to count, meaning you have to be around to claim before the timer expires. Don’t set a bunch of gathering on a 5 hour quest then go to bed for 8 hours!

This event lasts a week, **it is not a race**! Be picky about what you choose and make sure you are getting the best reward for the time invested!

## NDM Expectations

We have a minimum expectation of 1,200 points from every live person. This doesn't include farm alts, but the more points we get from those the better too! **I am going to be honest here, there is no reason to score under 1,500 points, and it is very easy if you have the time to check quests regularly to score 2,000 points even as a free to play player**. Watching for 200 point diamond, spoils chest, alliance coin and help quests are all free to do.

We do expect members to purchase that 10th attempt on their main accounts as well, through alliance gifts we easily generate enough diamonds for that.

## Quests
There are various types of quests available and some are significantly easier than others, some also have different point levels so be aware of what you are choosing! There are a few quests missing here, but honestly if they aren't listed they probably aren't worth it (or I forgot)

### Easiest / Best Quests

* **Receive Spoils Chest** - Join any rebel camp rally and receive one chest. Note you must have room for the chest, if your Merchant Guild is full you will not complete the quest. Watch specifically for the 200 point versions of these.
* **Spend Diamonds** - This is blue diamonds. These are exceptionally easy because resetting your Iron Bank over and over until you spend enough diamonds completes this quest. Again watch for the 299 point versions.
* **Buy Game Packs** - This one is clearly just for spenders but pays quite well. The best one is 10 packs for 285 points. ONLY packs in the Black Diamond shop count, no other black diamond purchases count. So special packs that appear if you run out of blue diamonds, or purchases in the Merchant ship don't count.
* **Help Alliance Members** - Just click helps. We have a member running helps about every 10 seconds 24/7 and we have other members that can run quick helps when requested. Watch for the 140 help quest which pays 200 points. It's best if we can get multiple members at once doing these quests.
* **Complete Alliance Quests** - This is the Alliance Quests tab under Quest in your bottom bar. If you have amassed Quest Refresh vouchers this can be a really quick and easy one. If you do not have enough quest refresh vouchers do NOT take this quest.
* **Spend Alliance Coins** - Another easy one if you have the coins. But be sure you have enough and watch for the 200 point ones!
* **Weirwood Attempts** - This one has a 200 point version, but it eats a lot of hearts especially if you do it on Elite for medals. Much quicker to do on normal obviously.

### Easy but Less Great Quests
* **Transport Resources** - While these are easy to complete they can be deceiving and expensive when you take tax into account. **Check the amount CAREFULLY**, with no thousands separators this is one of the ones that is easy to pick one that is higher than you can easily complete.
* **Exchange with the Merchant Ship** - This quest is super easy, but the higher point ones lock you in for a long time since you only get to exchange a maximum of 4 times every 6 hours for a mzximum of 16 in a 24 hour period.
* **Mysterious Chests** - This is the Chest in the upper right that refreshes and gives you prizes for claiming it. Be warned, your chests will almost all go to very long refreshes after taking this quest. The 200 point one will take you nearly a day to complete if not longer!
* **Gathering Quests** - Relatievly easy, but lock you in for a long time. The better paying ones are very high amounts, and honestly being locked in this long is not great.
* **Use speedup for** - Easy enough if you have the speedups, but there are no 200 point versions of this
* **Execute Lords** - Again not very hard, especially with HOF alts, but no 200 point versions of this either.
* **Initiate Rallies** - You need to be the leader of x number of rebel camp rallies. Level doesn't matter and gaining the chest doesn't matter. No 200 point versions, max I think is 153

### Harder, almost not worth it
* **Power quests** - There are different versions of this, basic power, research and training. The numbers are deceptively high for the good paying ones. Be VERY careful when taking these that you can actually complete them.
* **Finish in the top x of Elite or Normal y times** - This is for the Elite and Normal events, when the event ends sometimes you'll get a ranking reward. Since you cannot gaurantee to be in the top whatever these are questionable for regular players. Players with a ton of speedups or are heavy spenders can complete them pretty easily though.
* **Heal Troops** - Not hard but expensive, and pays crap. Not worth it.
* **Complete the Third Stage** - Again related to the Elite and Normal quests, these can pay okay if you want to burn speedups, but not that worth it in my opinion.
