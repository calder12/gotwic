Blanking is a battle strategy that allows you to participate in battles without fear of being zeroed (attacked and having all your troops hospitalized or killed). **One mistake many players make is training too many troops, and the game entices us to do this**. Don't make this mistake unless you are very confident in your fighting abilities or are a heavy spender. Average spenders, and free to play players should never train more troops than they can blank. Ever.

There are a number of ways you can hide troops from attack. All of these methods can be increased by increasing your march size, through a Sept of Seven march buff, research, castle skins, and Tavern buffs with the exception of Shelter, which explains how to increase its capacity below.

The number of troops you can blank has a lot of variables. Number of marches you have (castle level and researches), march capacity (castle level, research, castle skins, Tavern buffs, Battle buffs), and commander levels. Any level 25 castle should be able to blank well over a million troops. You need to figure out yourself what you can blank and/or cover with your hospitals.

## Hospital Capacity

While not technically blanking, you can take your hospital capacity into account since the goal here is to end up with no dead, not avoid wounded.

## Shelter

This is your first tool. Your shelter will hold base 200,000 troops at castle level 25. You can add another 11,000 when a VIII lord accompanies your troops to shelter. The latest Westeros Pass castle for royal pass holders increases this by another 100,000 and there is a research under Commandership to increase it further. When not attacking, for example if you are filling rallies for a siege or attack on an enemy player, always put your lord in shelter. You can immediately recall these troops.

## Fake Rebel Camp Rally

Start an 8 hour rally against a rebel camp. Send your highest rank commanders to increase your march size. Do NOT send your dragon, as you want that to be involved in any rallies you are participating in. With march buffs and other increase methods even relatively small players can get 300,000 plus troops in a rally. The upside here is you can immediately recall your troops by canceling the rally. **Watch rallies, do NOT join other players 8 hour rallies, you cannot recall them. If you need one create your own**

## Garrison / Reinforce

When available, for example during Castle Siege, you can garrison or reinforce a bubbled alliance mate. Just like the fake rebel rally send your highest ranked commanders to increase your march size when garrisoning. I suggest garrison because reinforce doesn't allow commanders meaning your march will be smaller. Reinforce if you don't need to garrison is fine, for example if you only have to hide another 100,000 troops the commanders aren't needed. **Caveat - Since this is a march you have to be careful recalling them. Enemies can see the marches coming back and try to snipe them when they get home.**

## Resource nodes

This is the least useful just because of timing. Since troops cannot be attacked while they are marching, you can choose some far away nodes, 300-400 kms and send full marches, including commanders to increase march size, to gather. The upside here is they can't be attacked while marching. The downside is you have to be sure to never let them land, or the node can be attacked, and also you have to wait for them to march back to teleport. Plus like the garrison/reinforce method your returning troops can be sniped.

## Occupy / Camp

**Do NOT do this**. Ever. Seriously don't even think about it. Don't even attempt to do it like resource nodes. If you send to an occupy all your opponent has to do is port to the place you are marching to, then port out immediately. Since when they land your camp march becomes an attack, them porting out makes it hit immediately. There is NO safety in camps. Forget that option even exists unless you're looking for wounded for the Westeros Pass quests.
